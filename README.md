# It is a social media website made by me.

# Here I have implemented the following ideas:-

1. I have firstly used python and django for backend work,
2. Html, Css and Js for some front-end styling,
3. Separate views and urls have been assigned for the folders
   accounts, groups, posts, simplesocial.
5. I have also imported misaka for creating custom renders as it comprises a fast HTML renderer.
6. django. contrib. staticfiles provides a convenience management command for gathering static files in a single directory.
7. "static" and "templates" folders are used here for formulating static files and design-related stuff respectively.

# I have used Visual Studio Code as respective python IDE.
